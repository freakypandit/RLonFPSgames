Approach to Solve Problems in GameBot

1. capture the gaming screen

2. with Opencv or image detection technique find object of interest
    eg. for driving car we must know how a car looks how to get into car and how to drive car on roads, 
        we can use lanes to detect roads.
    eg. for picking a gun we must know how a gun and matching ammos look.

3. Using python to input keyboard data (our architecture should be able to acces game)

4. Finding region of interest of each object. 
    eg. for driving its mainly below the horizon.
    eg. for picking guns its in lower region of scrren.
